| What do Christian scouts actually do and why is the neckerchief so important? Scout Jonas explains this in the podcast "echt gefragt".

Jonas tells me in our conversation that **recognition has always been important** in his life – it was and still is incredibly important to him. **With the scouts**, he **found** this recognition, and **without being judged or performance pressure**. Here he knows that he is accepted, **no matter how he's doing**.

His mother sent him to the scouts at the age of **eight**. At first, it was "a bit lame" for him, he says in the podcast "echt gefragt - der Talk mit Lotte". But that changes quickly: He finds connection and enjoys the games. With a smile, he says: **"Scouting is an absolute nerd hobby."**

### Why the Scout Neckerchief is More Than Just a Piece of Cloth

When Jonas comes to the podcast appointment, he's wearing his neckerchief, which already looks a bit worn. It quickly becomes clear: **This neckerchief is valuable. Not only because it has experienced a lot, but also because it is traditionally awarded.** Because with Christian scouts, after a few years, you commit to the group and make a **scout promise**. 

> *"Trusting in God's help, I promise to be a Christian scout and to live with you according to our rules."*
>- Promise in the german Verband Christlicher Pfadfinder\*innen

Only after that do they receive their neckerchief. **In the podcast, Jonas explains** the exact background and also why it's **already his second neckerchief**. Feel free to listen in.

### How Scouting Strengthens Self-Worth

Jonas says he **blossomed through scouting**. He was **entrusted with small tasks** early on. Examples of such tasks: reading a map during a car ride or getting pasta for all the children.

**At the same time, children were trusted with real responsibility**. Jonas remembers a camp where he, as a ten-year-old, was supposed to watch the campfire together with a friend. Such experiences have made him grow and also strengthened his self-worth. 

In the podcast "echt gefragt" he repeatedly emphasizes **the joint formulation of rules. This being allowed to have a say did him particularly good. The values** he learned with the scouts still shape him today - **also in his start-up, which he leads.**

So children go through several stages in scouting: **from playfully learning rules to leadership tasks that already begin at the age of 14.** Today, Jonas actually works in a leadership position and learned the first knowledge about it as a teenager.

For Jonas, **camps are still a place of peace today**. Otherwise, he says, he's always very active in everyday life and finds it hard to find peace. In a tent with friends, after an exhausting hike, he would find it and feel very comfortable and secure. 

> *"Moments in which I can perceive nature and creation are really wonderful."*

Here it becomes clear how **valuable scouting is for Jonas and how much it grounds him**. In addition, he also **found his great love** through the community. The couple lives near Marburg, has recently married, and is planning a big scout wedding in 2026. 

Scouts traditionally wish each other **"Gut Pfad!" (Be Prepared!) when saying goodbye**. A wish for a safe camps, and communal success. Like with Jonas and his community - it's about the **own path**, but also about **not walking it alone**.
