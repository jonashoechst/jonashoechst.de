  abstract  = {Research related to species conservation faces a dilemma: High-quality data must be recorded in a sufficient quantity in order to derive successful management measures. However, recording these data can be associated with disturbances that may, for example, negatively affect reproductive success. Automated systems for low-disturbance data collection offer a solution to this dilemma. We present here a system for automated collection of signals from VHF radio transmitters, the tRackIT system, and describe its application to telemetry of oystercatcher chicks Haematopus ostralegus in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany. The tRackIT system consists of tRackIT-stations as receiving units of radio signals in the field, an open-source operating system for the stations (tRackIT OS), and the backend provided by tRackIT Systems consisting of a metadatabase (EcoHub), analysis units based on time series databases, and a visualization unit where both, the incoming raw data from the stations and the products from the analysis units are visualized (Grafana). In spring 2022, we set up five tRackIT-stations in Beltring- harder Koog on the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein to automatically record signals from ten tagged Oystercatcher chicks between May and July and to test the suitability of the system for determining survival rates, causes of death and space use of oystercatcher chicks. Of the ten chicks that were tagged, two chicks likely lost the transmitter prematurely, six chicks did not survive the chick stage due to predation or disease, and two chicks fledged. Time of death and first flight could be determined to the minute in some cases. The probability of a chick fledging, estimated with the program MARK, was 35.3 \% ± 15.4 \%. From seven chicks only a few localizations were available, which could be attributed to an unfavorable spatial relationship of the chicks to the antennas. In three other chicks, 2,333 to 3,571 localizations were available during 18 to 30 days. The tRackIT system proved to be reliable. Storms lasting several days were withstood by the stations and only a few failures occurred, which were always quickly repaired. Precise data on the fate of the chicks could be determined and, in some cases, a high number of localizations could be made. In the following years we will continue the project. We expect that a higher number of tagged chicks and a relocation of the tRackIT-stations carried out after the experiences of the first season will provide extensive data that can be used to better understand the breeding success and population dynamics of oystercatchers in the study area.},

  abstract  = {Several areas of wireless networking, such as wireless sensor networks or the Internet of Things, require application data to be distributed to multiple receivers in an area beyond the transmission range of a single node. This can be achieved by using the wireless medium&rsquo;s broadcast property when retransmitting data. Due to the energy constraints of typical wireless devices, a broadcasting scheme that consumes as little energy as possible is highly desirable. In this article, we present a novel multi-hop data dissemination protocol called BTP. It uses a game-theoretical model to construct a spanning tree in a decentralized manner to minimize the total energy consumption of a network by minimizing the transmission power of each node. Although BTP is based on a game-theoretical model, it neither requires information exchange between distant nodes nor time synchronization during its operation, and it inhibits graph cycles effectively. The protocol is evaluated in Matlab and NS-3 simulations and through real-world implementation on a testbed of 75 Raspberry Pis. The evaluation conducted shows that our proposed protocol can achieve a total energy reduction of up to 90\% compared to a simple broadcast protocol in real-world experiments.},

While high-resolution observations of activity patterns can provide insights into the ecology of animal species, few methods are able to measure the activity of individuals of small taxa in their natural environment. We present a novel approach in which a combination of automatic radiotracking and machine learning is used to distinguish between active and passive behaviour in small vertebrates fitted with lightweight transmitters (<0.4 g). We used a dataset containing >3 million signals from very-high-frequency (VHF) telemetry from two forest-dwelling bat species (Myotis bechsteinii [n = 52] and Nyctalus leisleri [n = 20]) to train and test a random forest model in assigning either active or passive behaviour to VHF-tagged individuals. The generalisability of the model was demonstrated by recording and classifying the behaviour of tagged birds and by simulating the effect of different activity levels with the help of humans carrying transmitters. The model successfully classified the activity states of bats as well as those of birds and humans, although the latter were not included in model training (F1 0.96–0.98). We provide an ecological case-study demonstrating the potential of this automated monitoring tool. We used the trained models to compare differences in the daily activity patterns of two bat species. The analysis showed a pronounced bimodal activity distribution of N. leisleri over the course of the night while the night-time activity of M. bechsteinii was relatively constant. These results show that subtle differences in the timing of species' activity can be distinguished using our method. Our approach can classify VHF-signal patterns into fundamental behavioural states with high precision and is applicable to different terrestrial and flying vertebrates. To encourage the broader use of our radiotracking method, we provide the trained random forest models together with an R package that includes all necessary data processing functionalities. In combination with state-of-the-art open-source automated radiotracking, this toolset can be used by the scientific community to investigate the activity patterns of small vertebrates with high temporal resolution, even in dense vegetation.}

  abstract = {In the recent past, great progress has been made in three technological areas of computer science: sensing, softwarization of networks, and machine learning. Currently, a large variety of sensors is available in many devices, and sensors are getting smaller and more energy-efficient. Software-defined networks are becoming more widespread, achieving low latency and high throughput for emerging applications. Machine learning is very successful in creating and improving services in numerous applications at the edge and in the cloud. There is a great potential in the overlap of these areas: (a) smart processing of sensor data using machine learning methods makes potentially huge amounts of data manageable; (b) adaptive networks support the immediate availability of sensor data in several application areas, and (c) sensor data and machine learning methods are already used in the field of adaptive networks to improve the quality of service.
              In this thesis, approaches are presented to improve the quality of service, the quality of experience, and the quality of results of algorithms, protocols, and applications using different sensors and sensor sources. The information analysis cost and the achievable quality of different approaches within the same domain are compared, and a novel classification of smart systems is presented. The main challenge is to balance the information analysis cost generated by additional communication, computation, and storage with the quality improvement achievable by the novel methods. This challenge is addressed by presenting different approaches, algorithms, and systems in the areas of environmental monitoring, adaptive disruption-tolerant networking, and transitional wireless networking.
              In the area of smart environmental monitoring, flexible single-board computers are used to realize improvements of various sensing tasks, especially spatial movement and visual / acoustic observation of bats, as well as automated recognition of bird species in audio recordings.
              In the area of smart adaptive disruption-tolerant networking, different implementations of disruption-tolerant networks, systems for opportunistic execution of functions and workflows, and novel sensor-based routing algorithms are presented.
              Insights from the two areas will be used to develop novel approaches in the area of smart transitional wireless networks for classifying network traffic flow using machine learning, for dynamic announcement intervals in service discovery, and for Wi-Fi connection loss prediction to perform seamless Wi-Fi/cellular handovers.}

We present ProgDTN, a novel approach to support programmable disruption-tolerant networking by allowing network operators to implement and adapt routing algorithms without knowledge of a router's interior workings using the popular JavaScript language.

Direct observation of marked individuals (commonly applied to birds) is not possible for bats due to their small size, rapid movement, and nocturnal lifestyle, while neither popular observation methods such as camera traps nor conventional tracking technologies sufficiently capture the behavior of individuals. The combination and networking of different sensors in a single system can overcome these limitations, but this potential has been explored only to a limited extent.
               We present BatRack, a multi-sensor device that combines ultrasonic audio recordings, automatic radio telemetry, and video camera recordings in a single modular unit. BatRack facilitates the individual or combined scheduling of sensors and includes a mutual triggering mode. It consists of off-the-shelf hardware and both its hardware blueprints and the required software have been published under an open license to allow scientists and practitioners to replicate the system.
               We tested the suitability of radio telemetry and audio sensors as camera triggers and evaluated the detection of individuals in video recordings compared to radio telemetry signals. Specifically, BatRack was used to monitor the individual swarming behavior of six members of a maternity colony of Bechstein’s bat. Preliminary anecdotal results indicate that swarming intensity is related to reproductive state and roost switching..
               BatRack allows researchers to recognize individual bats and monitor their behavioral patterns using an easily deployed and scalable system. BatRack is thus a promising approach to obtaining detailed insights into the behavioral ecology of bats.}

Gathered data can be offloaded from monitoring devices to data sinks in a wireless sensor network using available radio access technologies, but this process also needs to be as energy-efficient as possible. This paper presents an approach to combine the benefits of high-throughput WiFi and robust low-power LoRa communication for energy-efficient data offloading. WiFi is only used when connectivity between mobile devices and data sinks is available, which is determined by LoRa-based distance estimations without the need for additional GPS sensors. A prototypical implementation on low-end commodity-off-the-shelf hardware is used to evaluate the proposed approach in a German mixed forest using a simple path loss model for distance estimation. The system provides an offloading success rate of 87%, which is similar to that of a GPS-based approach, but with around 37% less power consumption.}

Commands can be issued in the guest operating system, providing access to the distribution specific tools, e.g., to configure hardware parameters.

For both types of attack, we have built tools that can easily be used on mobile phones or Raspberry Pis (e.g., Bluetooth sniffers). The goal of our work is to perform a reality check towards possibly providing empirical real-world evidence for these two privacy and security risks. We hope that our findings provide valuable input for developing secure and privacy-preserving digital contact tracing systems.}

Through a custom firmware for low-cost LoRa capable micro-controller boards, called rf95modem, common devices for end users can be enabled to use LoRa through a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or serial connection. We present two applications utilizing the flexibility provided by the proposed firmware. First, we introduce a novel device-to-device LoRa chat application that works a) on the two major mobile platforms Android and iOS and b) on traditional computers like notebooks using a console-based interface. Second, we demonstrate how other infrastructure-less technology can benefit from our approach by integrating it into the DTN7 delay-tolerant networking software. The firmware, the device-to-device chat application, the integration into DTN7, as well as the experimental evaluation code fragments are available under permissive open-source licenses.}

  abstract  = {During and after the event of a crisis, means of communication are vital for civilians and professional responders alike. In particular, technologies such as disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) can play a key role to distribute data even under challenging network conditions. Such networks benefit from an increased number of mobile participants, since they help distribute messages to remote places. Unfortunately, it is unrealistic to assume that smartphone vendors will ship the necessary software or users will be prepared with the needed apps installed before the crisis happens. Currently, smartphone apps usually need Internet connections to be installed from an app store and/or are very platform specific, i.e., there is no general device-to-device app distribution. We present a novel solution to let any user with a web browser persistently participate in a DTN network. By leveraging a newly written Bundle Protocol 7 draft implementation in the programming language Rust and deploying to WebAssembly, we provide a secure and efficient way for backend and frontend DTN networks.
               The presented solution incorporates classic DTN daemons and access points for web app distribution and bundle synchronisation. Through benchmarks we show the efficient processing of bundles and the feasibility of bundle handling in browsers. All code is available as open-source under a permissive license.}

  abstract  = {Emerging network architectures like Information-Centric Networking (ICN) offer inherent simplicity in the data plane by addressing named data. Such flexibility opens up the possibility to move data processing inside network elements for high-performance computation, widely known as in-network processing. However, existing ICN architectures are limited in terms of (i) in-network processing and (ii) data plane programming abstractions. Such architectures can benefit from Complex Event Processing (CEP), an in-network processing paradigm to efficiently process data inside the data plane. Yet, it is extremely challenging to integrate CEP because the current communication model of ICN is limited to consumer-initiated interaction that comes with significant overhead in number of requests to process continuous data streams. In contrast, a change to producer-initiated interaction, as favored by CEP, imposes severe limitations for request-reply interactions.
               
               In this paper, we propose an in-network CEP architecture, INetCEP that supports unified interaction patterns (consumer- and producer-initiated) over ICN. In addition, we provide a CEP query language and facilitate CEP operations while increasing the range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications that can be supported by ICN. We provide an open source implementation and evaluation of INetCEP over an ICN architecture, Named Function Networking and two IoT applications: energy forecasting in smart homes and a disaster scenario.},

Our approach relies on data provided by multiple smartphone sensors (e.g., Wi-Fi RSSI, acceleration, compass, step counter, air pressure) to predict Wi-Fi connection loss and uses Multipath TCP to dynamically switch between different connectivity modes. We train a random forest classifier and an artificial neural network on real-world sensor data collected by five smartphone users over a period of three months. The trained models are executed on smartphones to reliably predict Wi-Fi connection loss 15 seconds ahead of time, with a precision of up to 0.97 and a recall of up to 0.98. Furthermore, we present results for four DASH video streaming experiments that run on a Nexus 5 smartphone using available Wi-Fi/cellular networks. The neural network predictions for Wi-Fi connection loss are used to establish MPTCP subflows on the cellular link. The experiments show that our approach provides seamless wireless connectivity, improves quality of experience of DASH video streaming, and requires less cellular data compared to handover approaches without Wi-Fi connection loss predictions.},

Computation offloading is particularly challenging in situations where network connectivity is periodic, intermittent, or error-prone. In this paper, we present OPPLOAD, a novel framework designed for offloading computational workflows in opportunistic networks that provide support for communication in such situations. The individual tasks forming a workflow can be assigned to particular remote execution platforms, called workers, either preselected ahead of time or decided just in time where a matching worker will automatically be assigned for the next task in the workflow. Workers announce their capabilities, i.e., tasks are only assigned to capable workers. Furthermore, tasks of a workflow can be executed on multiple workers that are automatically selected to balance the overall load. OPPLOAD also offers the ability to handle several types of error and exceptions appropriately. Our Python implementation of OPPLOAD, which uses the Serval Mesh to handle networking and routing, is publicly available as open source software. The results of our experimental evaluation demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.}

  abstract  = {Currently, nearly four billion people live in urban areas. Since this trend is increasing, natural disasters or terrorist attacks in such areas affect an increasing number of people. While information and communication technology is crucial for the operation of urban infrastructures and the well-being of its inhabitants, current technology is quite vulnerable to disruptions of various kinds. In future smart cities, a more resilient urban infrastructure is imperative to handle the increasing number of hazardous situations. We present a novel resilient communication approach based on smart street lights as part of the public infrastructure. It supports people in their everyday life and adapts its functionality to the challenges of emergency situations. Our approach relies on various environmental sensors and in-situ processing for automatic situation assessment, and a range of communication mechanisms (e.g., public WiFi hotspot functionality and mesh networking) for maintaining a communication network. Furthermore, resilience is not only achieved based on infrastructure deployed by a digital city's municipality, but also based on integrating citizens through software that runs on their mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). Web-based zero-installation and platform-agnostic apps can switch to device-to-device communication to continue benefiting people even during a disaster situation. Our approach, featuring a covert channel for professional responders and the zero-installation app, is evaluated through a prototype implementation based on a commercially available street light.}

In this paper, we present opportunistic named functions, a novel approach to operate ICN-DTNs during emergencies. Affected people and first responders use their mobile devices to specify their interests in particular content and/or application-specific functions that are then executed in the network on the fly, either partially or totally, in an opportunistic manner. Opportunis-tic named functions rely on user-defined interests and on locally optimal decisions based on battery lifetimes and device capabilities. In the presented emergency scenario, they are used to preprocess, analyze, integrate and transfer information extracted from images produced by smartphone cameras, with the aim of supporting the search for missing persons and the assessment of critical conditions in a disaster area. Experimental results show that opportunistic named functions reduce network congestion and improve battery lifetime in a network of battery-powered sensors, mobile devices, and mobile routers, while delivering crucial information to carry out situation analysis in disasters.}

To perform resource management, mobile wireless networks can particularly profit from classifying and predicting mobile application traffic. State-of-the-art traffic classification approaches have various disadvantages: port-based classification methods can be circumvented by choosing non-standard ports, protocol fingerprinting can be confused by the use of encryption, and current supervised learning methods for analyzing the statistical properties of network flows try to detect predefined classes, such as e-mail or FTP traffic, learned during training. In this paper, we present a novel approach to unsupervised traffic flow classification using statistical properties of flows and clustering based on a neural autoencoder. In contrast to previous work, the neural autoencoder is used to automatically cluster traffic flows, for example, into downloads, uploads, or voice calls, independent of the particular network protocols, such as FTP or HTTP(S), used for performing these tasks. A novel time interval based feature vector construction and a semi-automatic cluster labeling method facilitate traffic flow classification independent of known traffic classes or classification constraints. An experimental evaluation of the proposed approach on real data captured from about 25 mobile devices performing daily work over a period of 4 months is presented. The obtained results show that 7 different classes of mobile traffic flows are detected with an average precision of 80\% and an average recall of 75\%, indicating the feasibility of our approach.}

This can be illustrated by service announcements sent in ZeroConf, routing announcements used in OLSR, and peer announcements in wireless peer-to-peer or delay-tolerant networking systems such as Forban and Serval. The main problem is that these protocols use fixed time intervals between subsequent broadcast announcements. Fixed intervals can either lead to high network load (if the announcement interval is too short) or delay the distribution of information between peers (if the announcement interval is too long). Repeatedly broadcasting announcements after fixed intervals also has a significant impact on the energy consumption of mobile devices operating in wireless networks. In this paper, we present several approaches to realize dynamic announcement intervals that facilitate fast reception from at least one other node while trying to keep the overall communication overhead as low as possible. Experimental results in terms of performance properties and energy consumption are presented to illustrate the benefits of dynamic announcement intervals in wireless on-demand networks.},

Furthermore, since mobile phones have a limited battery capacity, we take a closer look at the battery drain resulting from using Serval over different communication links, such as WiFi and Bluetooth. Our purpose in providing these analyses is to understand the current capability of Serval and identify any areas where further improvement is required, and to provide a summary of current readiness of Serval in advance of planned pilots in the Pacific region.},
