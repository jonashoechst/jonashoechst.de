	ABSTRACT = "Several protocols used in wireless networks rely on nodes announcing
	information to other nodes. This can be illustrated by service
	announcements sent in ZeroConf, routing announcements used in OLSR, and
	peer announcements in wireless peer-to-peer or delay-tolerant networking
	systems such as Forban and Serval. The main problem is that these protocols
	use fixed time intervals between subsequent broadcast announcements. Fixed
	intervals can either lead to high network load (if the announcement
	interval is too short) or delay the distribution of information between
	peers (if the announcement interval is too long). Repeatedly broadcasting
	announcements after fixed intervals also has a significant impact on the
	energy consumption of mobile devices operating in wireless networks. In
	this paper, we present several approaches to realize dynamic announcement
	intervals that facilitate fast reception from at least one other node while
	trying to keep the overall communication overhead as low as possible.
	Experimental results in terms of performance properties and energy
	consumption are presented to illustrate the benefits of dynamic
	announcement intervals in wireless on-demand networks."

    Abstract="Serval is an open-source, delay-tolerant wireless ad-hoc networking system
    designed to allow communications anywhere and anytime, despite the total
    loss of supporting telecommunications infrastructures provided by mobile
    phone operators. In emergency situations, Serval can be used to establish a
    disaster-response communications network spontaneously formed by mobile
    phones and/or battery powered wireless routers. In this paper, we present
    an in-depth experimental evaluation of Serval for various network setups
    and usage patterns, including simulated long term use. The focus of our
    evaluation is on the delay-tolerant aspects of Serval, providing insights
    into the scenarios where Serval can be deployed with satisfactory quality
    and performance characteristics. Furthermore, since mobile phones have a
    limited battery capacity, we take a closer look at the battery drain
    resulting from using Serval over different communication links, such as
    WiFi and Bluetooth. Our purpose in providing these analyses is to
    understand the current capability of Serval and identify any areas where
    further improvement is required, and to provide a summary of current
    readiness of Serval in advance of planned pilots in the Pacific region.",

    abstract = "Electronic mail is one of the oldest and widely used services in the Internet. In this paper, an empirical study of the security properties of email server communication within the German IP address space range is presented. Instead of investigating end-user security or end-to-end encryption, we focus on the connections between SMTP servers relying on transport layer security. We analyze the involved ciphers suites, the certificates used and certificate authorities, and the behavior of email providers when communicating with improperly secured email servers. Conclusions drawn from this analysis lead to several recommendations to mitigate the security issues currently present in the email system as it is deployed in the Internet."
