## printf("Hallo Welt!\n");

My name is Jonas Höchst, born in the year of 1992 I am either enjoying the mercy or suffering the curse of a late birth. For my seventh birthday my uncle made a *electronics experimental box*. At the age of twelve my first line of code looked something like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
	printf("Hallo Welt!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

In [middle school](http://www.lumdatalschule.de) my first **Homepage** went online, I installed my first **Linux** distro, built my first **Hackintosh** and flashed my first **Atmel** micro controller. I couldn't stop exploring the world of computers while the main bottleneck was a missing fast Internet connection.

I did my Abitur at [Landgraf-Ludwigs-Gymnasium](http://www.llg-giessen.de) in Gießen, set my focus to *mathematics and chemistry* but still had computer science in mind. Being a nineteen-year-old it is hard to decide on how to proceed in life. While luckily military duty was discontinued in Germany, I decided to go to [Philips-University of Marburg](http://www.uni-marburg.de) to study **computer science**.

Even though it's only a stones throw away from my home town [Rabenau](http://www.rabenau.de) I moved into a shared flat in Marburg with seven others, an experience I wouldn't want to miss.

The University courses deepened my understandings and once again widened my knowledge base. Especially the freely choosable subjects disclosed new fields like **IT Security** and **Distributed Systems** to me. Finally my bachelors thesis was a study of email transport security, which we later published at [IEEE TrustCom](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=7345294): *How to Misuse SMTP over TLS: A Study of the (In)Security of Email Server Communication* - [available at ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292552299_How_to_Misuse_SMTP_over_TLS_A_Study_of_the_InSecurity_of_Email_Server_Communication).

I am a computer scientist by passion, looking forward to finish my masters degree soon and being involved into thrilling **research** projects in the future.

## Scouting for <s>boys</s> *me*

I am a boy scout since I was **eight** years old. Scouting is an *elementally part of my personality* and helped me in various situations. At the age of fifteen our local group almost collapsed. Other scouts helped, I became a group leader with sixteen and we managed to rebuilt it almost from scratch.

At nineteen I became ***Stammesführer***, who is in charge of organizing all parts of the local group. After that I became ***Regionssprecher*** who connects those and moderates processes between the local groups. Both jobs not only were fulfilling for my personal advancement but taught me a lot about managing things.

Impressions on scouting can be found at the website of my local group ([VCP Lumdatal](http://www.vcp-lumdatal.de)) or at the website of [Region Kurhessen](https://vcp-kurhessen.info).
